# ATAC_Seq_Workbook
PDF of workflow to analyze ATAC seq and CRISPR screening data.

ATAC-seq is a molecular biology technique to see how "open" the chromatin around a certain region is. This is a proxy for how much transcription is taking place at a particular locus.

I developed a jupyter notebook to compare our ATAC-seq data to our CRISPR screening data. The CRISPR scores represent how essential a gene is. If the score is negative, the cells were at a disadvantage when they lost this gene.

The purpose of these experiments were to see if there were any correlations between ATAC-seq and CRISPR scores. This was primarily done through data visualizations in the notebook.
